## Installation

First of all, install _Cocoapods_ if you don't have it installed yet.

```ruby 
sudo gem install cocoapods
```


Go to your project directory (where is located the _Podfile_) and run this command:

```ruby
pod install
```

## Keep in mind
Don't open __.xcodeproj__ file, open __xcworkspace__ instead. Otherwise, you will come across different compiling issues.

## For further develop
	- Filter and search products
	- Rate other users
	- Adapt all remaining CollectionViews to IGListKit
	- Add push notifications on received messages and invitations.
	- Add dynamic links
	- Create tests
	- Show more messages on error responses
